# Mode Switcher

This project demonstrates a simple JavaScript implementation of a mode switcher. It allows switching between different modes (`dark`, `light`, and `ninja`), each associated with specific colors, images, and labels.

## Installation

There is no installation required for this project. Simply clone or download the repository to your local machine.

##Usage

To use the mode switcher, follow these steps:

Open the index.html file in your web browser.
The mode is initially set to "light". You can change the mode by modifying the mode variable in the script.js file.
Depending on the mode selected, the color, image, and label will be updated accordingly.
